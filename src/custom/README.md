# Use this folder for all custom code.

- This folder is intended for any custom code that you may need to add to the project. By placing your custom code here, you can ensure that it remains separate from the core codebase.
- This separation allows you to merge the latest changes from the main branch without overwriting any of your custom modifications.
- This approach helps maintain the integrity of your custom code while keeping it up-to-date with the latest improvements and bug fixes from the main project.
